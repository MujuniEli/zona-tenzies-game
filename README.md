# Tenzies Game

This project was part of the Learn React Course on Scrimba.



## Overview

This project was started in the course but I wanted to customize it and make the experience more personal and therefore more fun to play so I have had to come up with features and now am in the process of implementing them.

* Start Game button opens game with dice faces showing and also indicating first player can roll dice 
* Player can freeze dice faces that he/she desires.
* Game ends when all dice faces are matched.
* Player's names and roll count recorded and displayed on the aside.



## Built with

* ReactJS
* CSS
* [game-icon.net](https://game-icons.net/)
* [nanoid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nanoid)



## What I have learned

Customizing this project from what we had in the course by adding features hasn't been easy but I have got the opportunity to fully grasp concepts like managing images in react ie importing and mapping through these images to properly display them. My understandinng of props and how we handle them has also been strengthened by this project



## Continued Development

This app is a work in progress as am adding features to personalize the gaming experince like player details and will also continously make the code more clean and DRY
